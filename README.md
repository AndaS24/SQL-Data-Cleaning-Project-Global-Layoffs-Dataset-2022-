SQL Data Cleaning Project: Global Layoffs Dataset (2022)

Overview:
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Layoffs 2022 dataset using SQL. The dataset contains real-world data on global layoffs across various industries and companies during 2022. The goal was to transform the raw, messy data into a clean and consistent format, ready for analysis or further processing.

Tools & Skills Used:
SQL (MySQL)
Data Cleaning Techniques
Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER())
CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
String and Date Manipulation
NULL Handling & Deduplication

Cleaning Steps
1. Create a Staging Table
A duplicate of the original dataset was created (layoffs_staging) to preserve raw data and allow flexible, safe transformations.

2. Remove Duplicates
Applied ROW_NUMBER() to identify duplicate rows based on multiple key columns.
Deleted rows with a row number greater than 1 (true duplicates).

3. Standardize and Fix Data
Converted blank fields to NULL for consistency.
Unified inconsistent entries (e.g., CryptoCurrency, Crypto Currency â†’ Crypto).
Trimmed country names (e.g., removed trailing periods in United States.).
Converted date strings to SQL DATE format using STR_TO_DATE().

4. Handle Missing Values
Used JOIN logic to fill in missing industry values where other entries for the same company had this info.
Retained missing values in numeric fields (total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off) for accurate statistical handling later.

5. Remove Irrelevant Data
Dropped rows where both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off were NULL.
Removed helper columns (e.g., row_num) used during cleaning.

Final Output
A fully cleaned SQL table (layoffs_staging2) ready for:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization
Reporting & Insights
